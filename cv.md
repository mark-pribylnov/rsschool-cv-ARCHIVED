### About me  
I can describe my strengths with one word - persistence.
This quality allows you to gain other skills and succeed in anything. With time you adapt to any situation, become more efficient in problem solving, teamwork and so on. It's inevitable.

I worked as a salesman for one and a half years. Also tried working as a marketer.  
Eventually, I decided to become a software engineer for a number of reasons:
- Ability to use English in real situations
- Creating really useful apps, even for personal use
- Remote work
- Huge supportive community
- It's a challenge. My previous job was outbound sales. One of the most stressful jobs. Requires constant self-education. I got 50 to 100 rejections every day and had to convert them into sales. So, if I worked there, I can become a software engineer as well.
